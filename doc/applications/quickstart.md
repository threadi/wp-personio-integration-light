# Quick start for the use of applications

## Requirements

* Both plugins [Personio Integration Light](https://wordpress.org/plugins/personio-integration-light/) and [Personio Integration](https://laolaweb.com/en/plugins/personio-wordpress-plugin/) must be installed and activated.
* A valid license for the Pro version must be stored.
* A Personio URL must be specified and open positions should be imported.

## Sequence of steps

1. Go to Settings > Applications in WordPress-backend.
2. Select the value "_application form_" for the field "_Application in list view_" or/and "_Application in detail view_".
3. Save the setting by clicking on "Save changes".
4. After that, the application form is immediately available for all positions.

## Notes
