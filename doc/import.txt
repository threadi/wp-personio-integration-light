Import of positions from Personio
=================================

Condition:
- An URL for the Personio-account, whose positions are to be imported, must be set under Positions > Settings

Method 1: Automatic
-------------------

Steps:
* enable automatic import under Positions > Settings
* set an interval for the automatic import under Positions > Settings

Hints:
- Import is started automatically at the specified intervals when Personio content has changed.
- The import is controlled on the way via WP Cron and is thus also dependent on visitor traffic.
- If more than 200 items are imported, it is not recommended to use this way because of the time it takes to import them.

Method 2: Manual
----------------

Steps:
* disable automatic import under Positions > Settings
* set up a cronjob on the hosting that calls the following command at intervals you specify: wp personio getPositions

Hints:
- It is not necessary to disable WP Cron in Wordpress.
- This method is recommended when large amounts of data are to be imported.

Method 3: Partial
-----------------

Steps:
* enable partial import under Positions > Settings
* set an interval for the partial import under Positions > Settings

Hints:
This import can be initialized in 2 ways:
* Per WP Cron in the defined interval.
* Or via system cronjob in hosting by calling this command: wp personio runPartialImport
It will be used automatically if automatic import is active.
