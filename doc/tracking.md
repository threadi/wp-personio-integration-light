## Tracking for counting views and events

## Requirements

* Google Analytics 4 or Tag Manager
* Personio Position PRO plugin
* Optional tracking plugin like Borlabs or MonsterInsights

## Setup without tracking plugin.

- In the WordPress backend, go to Posts > Settings > Tracking.
- Activate tracking there.
- Below that, in the field, enter the measurement ID that you want the tracking to run on.
- Below that activate the events.
  * Optionally, you can still customize the event names.
- Save.

## Setup with tracking plugin

- In the WordPress backend go to Jobs > Settings > Tracking.
- Activate there only the events and adjust their event names, if desired.
- The rest will then be taken care of by the tracking plugin you are using.

### Note

It may be necessary to adjust the gtag name. There is also an input field for this on the above page.
